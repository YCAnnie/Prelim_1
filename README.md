# P1
Problem 1 is included in the prelim1 pdf file.
# P2
Part a:
Run problem2a.jl to get the plot of part a. This file is modified from PS2 solution. p2a.png shows the plot.

Part b:
There are several files required for this problem.
17 json files,
17 p2b files,
2b_parameters_annie,
and 2brun

Keep all these in the same folder and run 2brun.jl. You also need to include problem2a.jl and ICT1.json for this.

(I tried many methods but I really cannot get sensitivity matrix from Julia or matlab. There were errors showing up. My idea is that I increase each parameter 10% larger and create new json files and then run p2b files to get new concentration. Compare with the original concentration then we can know the difference of concentration. Use the concept of central difference(concentration difference/2(parameter difference))to calculate the partial derivative and get sensitivity matrix.)

Part c:
Since I cannot figure out part b...

# P3
Part a and c are included in the prelim1 pdf file.
For part b, run problem3b_try.m to get the plot of steady state protein level versus inducer concentration. 3b.jpg shows the plot.
